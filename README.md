## Introduction

A vital part of SAP since 2012, SAP SuccessFactors is a world-leading provider of cloud human experience management (HXM) â€“ the new people-focused term for HCM. Our HXM suite lets you provide employees with experiences that recognize their individual value and consistently motivate them to achieve peak performance levels.

This connector is created based on the endpoints below, which retrieve the suitable fields to map a HelloID person. Note that the properties on the contracts are mostly reference codes to additional lists. To get a meaningful display name, these lists must be implemented.

Sap Successfactors operates with multiply endpoints which combined get a full HelloID person and contracts. The first endpoint PerPerson retrieves all the persons but does not contains any Personal Information. This can be retrieved with the PerPersonal endpoint, although this can be done after the person actually starts working. So as a result there are multiple persons without a name or display name. This must be solved when implementing the connector with the customer's needs. It's possible to retrieve future person information with the parameter 'asofdate', at the moment this is now not implemented. The same applies for Employments and EmploymentsJobs.
